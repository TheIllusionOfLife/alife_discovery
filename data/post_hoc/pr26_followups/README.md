# PR26 Follow-Up Canonical Bundle

This directory is the tracked lightweight bundle for PR26 follow-up outputs.

- Keep only compact reproducibility artifacts here:
  - `manifest.json`
  - `checksums.sha256`
  - summary JSON/CSV files consumed by paper scripts
- Store heavy/raw artifacts in Zenodo and record DOI + file metadata in
  `manifest.json`.
